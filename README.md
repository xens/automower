Introduction
============

Goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of Husqwarna
Automower lawnmowers, like adding remote-control features using
LoRa (https://www.lora-alliance.org) adapters.


Status
======

For now I only have very basic things in place to talk to
the device, either using a laptop with a RS232<->TTL adapter
or an Arduino.


Next steps / Ideas
==================

* Have a clean code-base for Arduino and PC
* Add some diagrams / documentation
* Make tests with LoRa modules for Arduino
* Implement a basic API
